Wind River® Helix™ App Cloud
==

> Wind River® Helix™ App Cloud speeds creation of Internet of Things (IoT) software for system manufacturers, integrators, and operators. Simulating a development environment, it allows you to use the Pulsar SDK to write applications even without a hardware platform.

> Wind River® Helix™ App Cloud is a new kind of software development platform that removes the traditional complexities of building applications for embedded devices and systems.

> To help start your embedded projects, App Cloud comes with Wind River Rocket™, our free real-time operating system (RTOS) for small, embedded devices.
